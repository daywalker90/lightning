# The original 11/11 was obtained with Alpine-built binaries and does not
# transfer:
# "The tarballs must still run on Ubuntu/Fedora/elsewhere" is the
# binding constraint of the whole Nix switch, so it has to be re-measured,
# not assumed.  35 did the amd64 rows; 36 extends it to the two cross rows,
# so the arch is read off the tarball name and picks both the row set and
# the `--platform` the foreign rows run under (host binfmt, as 26 did).
#
# Each row unpacks the tarball over / in a bare distro container and runs
# smoke.sh: --version, a regtest start, and a getmanifest
# handshake with every plugin (27/27 is the pass mark).
