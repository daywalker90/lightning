# VLS's `remote_hsmd_socket`, one static
# binary per release row.
#
# built this as a `vls` *pseudo-distro*: hooks only
# (`contrib/reprobuild/vls/build.sh` + `pins`), no image of its own,
# borrowing the Alpine static builder's sysroot, its `<triple>-clang`
# wrappers and its pinned protoc.  The Nix switch removed the thing it
# borrowed.
#
# What replaces it: a derivation generated over the same
# rows as CLN, so `nix build --rebuild` covers the bytes that are *signed*,
# the strip is asserted in-derivation, and the per-arch cargo
# target comes from the package set rather than a hand-written `arches` row.
#
# The one thing that makes this different from a fourth row of CLN: VLS is a
# **third-party repository at a pinned commit**, so it has its own source and
# its own crate closure.  Both are fixed-output derivations -- the network
# rule is satisfied the same way 35 satisfied it for cargo, by
# hashing before the build rather than trusting the build not to fetch.

  # which binary of the VLS workspace to build.
  #
  # `remote_hsmd_socket` is the released artifact.  `vlsd` is
  # the **signer daemon it talks to**, and it is built only so the release can
  # be *tested*: `remote_hsmd_socket` is CLN's hsmd replacement and does
  # nothing on its own but listen on port 7701 for vlsd to connect, so the
  # regtest smoke test -- which 46 runs every release -- has no signer without
  # it.  A test binary is never installed under a release name, never listed
  # in a manifest and never signed; it shares this file (and so the pin, the
  # vendor dir and the toolchain) precisely so the thing under test is built
  # from the same inputs as the thing shipped.
  # NB the `vls` prefix: `callPackage` supplies any argument whose name exists
  # in nixpkgs, and nixpkgs has a package called `binary` (`binary-5.3`), so a
  # plain `binary ? "remote_hsmd_socket"` default was silently replaced by that
  # derivation -- surfacing as an unsupported gobject-introspection four levels
  # into GTK, while building the *released* signer.  (`cargoPackage` is free
  # today; it is prefixed anyway, because the next name might not be.)

  # `.git`, and the build.rs falls back to the literal `git-desc-failed` --
  # deterministic, so reproducibility is unaffected, but every VLS we ever

  #
  # So: answer the one question build.rs asks, from the pin itself.  Not a

  # to git (only vls-util does; vls-signer-stm32 is excluded from the

  # the crates.io 403, one layer

  # `requests` script (`fetch-cargo-vendor-util`) that sets no UA at all, and
  # crates.io refuses `python-requests/<v>` exactly as it refuses
  # `curl/<v>`.  Every crate 404s -- 403s -- before the build starts.
  #
  # The script is a `let` binding inside nixpkgs' fetch-cargo-vendor.nix, so
  # there is nothing to `.override`; the only seam is the `writers` call that
  # builds it.  Doing that as a *flake overlay* was the first attempt and is
  # a trap worth recording: `fetchCargoVendor`'s outer derivation is an
  # ordinary runCommand that depends on the script, so patching `writers`
  # globally moves the derivation of every nixpkgs package that vendors
  # crates -- including the release toolchain (`x86_64-unknown-linux-musl-
  # cargo` went from 35rali2m... to x3yxsnpd...).  That is a
  # distribution-motivated change silently moving CLN's release bytes, which
  # is the exact failure class 's guards exist to catch.
  #
  # So the patch is scoped to *this* call: our own instance of nixpkgs'
  # fetcher, with a patched `writers` passed in.  Nothing outside VLS sees
  # it, and the vendor dir is fixed-output anyway, so the release bytes are
  # pinned by `vendorHash` either way.
  #
  # Both seams -- the internal file path and the exact line replaced -- can
  # move when the certified nixpkgs rev moves, and `replaceStrings` fails
  # silently: it changes nothing, and the fetch then 403s far from here.
